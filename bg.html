      <p class="lead">Second hand smoke is the main source of indoor air pollution, containing over 4000 harmful compounds, 3 typical toxic gas chemicals are selected to generate a smoke detector by sensing these toxics simultaneously. Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide
        are 2 colourless and odourless gases, which could cause serious health problems before being noticed. Formaldehyde is toxic even in low concentration. According to the Residential Indoor Air Quality Guidelines released by the Government of Canada
        [1], the exposure limits for NO, CO, formaldehyde are very strict (especially formaldehyde). Thus, the detector needs to be very sensitive.

      <h3>1.1 Nitric Oxide (NO) Sensing </h3>

      <p>NsrR is a regulatory protein which represses the transcription of promoter PyeaR by binding and blocking the operator [2]. Normally, NsrR is generated in E.Coli, in this design we add another gene that also generate NsrR, to make sure there is enough
        NsrR in cell to block the PyeaR transcription. In the presence of NO, which could inactivate NsrR, the association between repressor and operator is terminated, the expression of gene after PyeaR is reopened. A siRNA will be produced and stop
        the translation of LacI, then leads to GFP production.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Sensing</h3>

      <p>Based on [3], the protein CooA (originally found in R.rubrum), is only active in the presence of CO. The CooA-CO hybrid can activate promoter P(CooF), which has 2 CooA binding sites, according to the discovery of iGEM team METU_Turkey. Another siRNA
        is set at the downstream of promoter P(CooF), when CO is detected, siRNA will bind to its corresponding target and cause self-cut. No further protein will be produced.</p>

      <h3>1.3 Formaldehyde Sensing </h3>

      <p>According to the previous study [4] [5], the frmR protein, a transcriptional repressor of promoter PfrmR, is specifically inactivated by formaldehyde molecules. When formaldehyde is presented, it can attach the frmR protein and cause configuration
        change, results in the expression of another siRNA, which can also cut off the target gene and terminate the translation of LacI.</p>

      <h3>1.4 OR gate  </h3>

      <p>The design of the three-input OR gate is based on the study [6]. The gene has 3 different siRNA targets on its 3’-UTR, it can be normally transcript and translated to produce LacI protein with absence of siRNAs. However, when one or more siRNA complementary pairing
        to its matching target on mRNA, it will cause self-cleave and terminate translation.</p>

      <h3>1.5 Amplifier and Reporter  </h3>

      <p>To increase the sensitivity, a biological positive feedback amplifier based on [7] is introduced. The Plac promoter is repressed by LacI. When the production of LacI is terminated by any siRNA, a little LuxR will be generated by activated promoter
        Plac. In addition, P(LuxI) can only transcript in the presence of LuxR.Oonce the transcription is opened, LuxR will be continuously produced, then a large amount of GFP (green fluorescent protein) would be expressed. GFP exhibits bright green
        fluorescence to demonstrate the existence of second-hand smoke.</p>
