      <p class="lead">In this project, we proposed a second-hand smoke bio-detector, consisting of three gas-sensing devices coupling with an OR gate and an amplifier. With the knowledge of previous gas sensing researches, three very harmful chemicals that contained
        in smoke are chose as our targets, they are NO, CO and formaldehyde respectively. A siRNA controlled OR gate has been introduced to detect any of the sensing signal and transmit it to the reporter system. The utilization of a LuxR-amplifier along
        with the green fluorescent protein allows us to get clear result even the smoke concentration is relatively low.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">Comparing with the previous detecting designs, this proposed work has overcome two major weaknesses: firstly, simplex constituent detector whose power is not very strong, thus here we combined several single sensors together and efficiently increase
        the detecting power. Secondly, when the pollutant density is low, the corresponding reporter effect is also low, hence we amplified fluorescent effect by applying a LuxR amplifier, so a strong response of GFP can be visualized in all conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">By the incorporation of all the components, people can monitor and notify the existence of second hand smoke in home to protect their family members.
